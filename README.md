# Model-comparison-of-hate-speech-detection-across-different-social-media-platforms

This project is my master's degree dissertation work.

In this project, my ultimate goal was to achieve a hate speech or non-hate speech label from the text data. These texts are the comments extracted from different social media platforms. This project explored different models with a different set of word embedding. I observed how just using word embedding (I have used BERT embedding) with different models didnâ€™t make much difference. My idea was to propose an innovative model for ongoing research in this field. In this paper, I have proved how my novel solution has out performed all the models mentioned.
